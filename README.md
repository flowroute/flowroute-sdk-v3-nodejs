Requirements
------------

*   Flowroute [API credentials](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/)
*   [Node.js](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule) v6.10.3 or higher


* * *
Installation
------------

1. First, start a shell session and clone the Node.js library:
    * via HTTPS: `git clone https://github.com/flowroute/flowroute-sdk-v3-nodejs.git`

    * via SSH: `git@github.com:flowroute/flowroute-sdk-v3-nodejs.git`

2. Switch to the newly-created `flowroute-sdk-v3-nodejs` directory. `npm` is installed by default when Node is installed on your machine. This version of the library has been tested with `Node v6.10.3` and `npm 3.10.10` for Mac OS X. To see which version of `npm` is installed on your machine, run the following:

`npm --version`

**Node.js Library v3** should come with a `package.json` file listing all the required dependencies. Depending on your `npm` permissions, you may be required to preface each `npm` command with `sudo`. To install the dependencies, run:

`npm install`

If you encounter any missing package error, run the following:

`npm install <package_name>`

* * *
Usage
------------
In Flowroute's approach to building the Node.js library v3, HTTP requests are handled by controllers named after the API resources they represent: **Numbers**, **Routes**, **Messages**, **E911s**, and **CNAMs**. These controllers contain the tasks and callback functions used to perform messaging and number management which includes programmatic configuration of inbound voice routes, E911 addresses, and CNAM storage within the Node.js library.

## Controllers

The following shows **number_route_message_demo.js** as an example single file which imports the Flowroute API client and all the required modules. The Node.js library v3 comes with three demo files named after the API resources they interact with: **number_route_message_demo.js** for Numbers v2, Routes v2, and Messages v2.1, **e911_demo.js** for E911s v2, and **cnam_demo.js** for CNAMs v2. You can edit and run any of the demo files for testing purposes.

```node
#!/usr/bin/env node
require('dotenv').config();
const flowroute = require('./lib');

console.log("Number//Route//E911//CNAM Management v2 & Messaging v2.1 Demo");

// Set up your api credentials and test mobile number for outbound SMS or MMS
flowroute.Configuration.username = process.env.FR_ACCESS_KEY
flowroute.Configuration.password = process.env.FR_SECRET_KEY
mobile_number = process.env.MOBILE_NUMBER

// Instantiate API client and create controllers for Numbers, Messages, and Routes
var numbers_controller = flowroute.NumbersController;
var routes_controller = flowroute.RoutesController;
var messages_controller = flowroute.MessagesController;
```    

#### Credentials

As an example, we will be referencing the **number_route_message_demo.js** file. First, open up the file with your preferred code editor and replace `flowroute.Configuration.username` with your API Access Key and `flowroute.Configuration.password` with your API Secret Key from the [Flowroute Manager](https://manage.flowroute.com/accounts/preferences/api/). Note that in our example, we are accessing your Flowroute credentials as environment variables set in a `.env` file. This library should come with a configuration `.env` file that you can modify with your credentials and your mobile number for testing. To learn more about setting environment variables, see [How To Read and Set Environmental and Shell Variables](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-read-and-set-environmental-and-shell-variables-on-a-linux-vps).

```node
// Set up your api credentials and test mobile number for outbound SMS or MMS
flowroute.Configuration.username = process.env.FR_ACCESS_KEY
flowroute.Configuration.password = process.env.FR_SECRET_KEY
mobile_number = process.env.MOBILE_NUMBER
```

#### Instantiate API Client and Controllers
Next, instantiate the API Client and its controllers.

```node
// Instantiate API client and create controllers for Numbers, Messages, and Routes
const flowroute = require('./lib');
var numbers_controller = flowroute.NumbersController;
var routes_controller = flowroute.RoutesController;
var messages_controller = flowroute.MessagesController;
```

## Methods
The following section will demonstrate the capabilities of Numbers v2, Routes v2, Messages v2.1, E911s v2, and CNAMs v2 that are wrapped in the Flowroute Node.js Library v3. Note that the example responses have been formatted using Mac's `pbpaste` and `jq`. To learn more, see [Quickly Tidy Up JSON from the Command Line](http://onebigfunction.com/vim/2015/02/02/quickly-tidying-up-json-from-the-command-line-and-vim/).

### CNAM Record Management

The Flowroute Node.js Library v3 allows you to make HTTP requests to the `cnams` resource of Flowroute API v2: `https://api.flowroute.com/v2/cnams`.

All of the CNAM record management functions are encapsulated in `cnam_demo.js`.

#### listAccountCNAMRecords(options, callback) 

The function accepts a callback function and all the different CNAM query parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/list-account-cnam-records/). In the following example request, we will only retrieve 3 approved CNAM records. 
    
##### Example Request
```
var account_cnams = cnams_controller.listAccountCNAMRecords(limit=3, offset=null, isApproved=true, callback);
account_cnams.then(function(response) {
    console.log("--List Approved CNAM Records")
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
}, function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});
```
##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `200 OK` and the response body contains an array of cnam objects in JSON format.

The function accepts a Caller ID value, content type of `application/vnd.api+json`, and a callback function as parameters which you can learn more about in the [API reference](https://developer.flowroute.com/api/numbers/v2.0/create-a-new-cnam-record/). Note that you can enter up to 15 characters for your CNAM value.
    
| CNAM Storage Rules |
| ------------------- |
| You can enter up to 15 characters for your CNAM value at least one of which is a letter. |
| While most CNAM presets can be approved, the following are not allowed and must be rejected: |
|    -  Consist of curse words and/or is inappropriate. |
|    -  A phone number (CNAM must be a name not a number) |
|    -  If the CNAM preset which the customer has submitted appears to be misleading such as: |
|       - Political Figures or Places (Obama, Barack or The White House) |
|       - False or fake CNAM (Seattle Police) |

##### Example Request
```
var new_cnam = { "value":"Heartwood" };
var create_cnam = cnams_controller.createANewCNAMRecord(new_cnam, mContentType="application/vnd.api+json", callback);
create_cnam.then(function(response) {
    console.log("--Create a CNAM Record")
    console.log(JSON.stringify(response, null, 2));
}, function(err) {
  console.log(err);
});
```

##### Example Response

On success, the HTTP status code in the response header is `201 Created` and the response body contains the newly created cnam object in JSON format. Note that CNAM records take up to 48 hours to be approved on your account and further association with a phone number takes 5-7 business days.

```

#### Errors

In cases of function errors, the Node.js library raises an exception which includes an error message, and the HTTP body that was received in the request. 

##### Example Error
```shell
raise ErrorException('Forbidden – The server understood the request but refuses to authorize it.', _context)
```

#### Testing

Once you are done configuring your Flowroute API credentials and updating the function parameters, you can run any of the demo files to see them in action. The Flowroute library demo files are named after the resource they represent: &lt;resource_name&gt;_demo.js.

`node cnam_demo.js`
